ANSWER:
'''

import random

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
test_seed = int(input("Create a seed number: "))
random.seed(test_seed)

# Split string method
namesAsCSV = input("Give me everybody's names, seperated by a comma. ")
names = namesAsCSV.split(", ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# Long Form

# # Get the total number of items in list.
num_items = len(names)
# # Generate random numbers between 0 and the last index.
random_choice = random.randint(0, (num_items - 1))
person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice]

# # Short Form
# person_who_will_pay = random.choice(names)

print(f"{person_who_will_pay} is going to pay for the meal today!")
